Java provides memory management through its own mechanisms, and Java developers typically do not
need to deal directly with memory allocation or deallocation. Java's memory management includes
automatic garbage collection, which cleans up memory that is no longer in use. The Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) takes care of memory management for you.

However, if you have specific memory-related requirements or need to work with off-heap memory, you
might use third-party libraries or features such as Java's NIO (New I/O) package. NIO allows for more
direct and efficient memory manipulation, including memory-mapped files, buffers, and channels. It can
be useful for certain low-level operations and high-performance I/O.

Here's an example of using Java's New I/O (NIO) package to work with memory-mapped
files and memory buffers.
